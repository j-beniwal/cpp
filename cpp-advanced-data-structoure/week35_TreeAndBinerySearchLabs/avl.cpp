// AVL - New Node Function Lab

// Description

// Using the node definition below, write a function that creates a new node for an AVL tree that stores integers. Left, right should be set to null and the height should be set to 1.

// Use this definition for the nodes in the AVL tree:

// class Node 
// { 
//   public:
//   int key; 
//   Node *left; 
//   Node *right; 
//   int height; 
// }; 

// The Node is defined in a header file called cpluspluslabs.h that you should include in your code but not upload in your solution.

// Here is an example call to the function

// Node *root = new_node(10);

// After the above code executes the tree will have the value 10 in it..




// Function Signature

// Node* new_node(int key);

// File Name 

// avl.cpp

// Score

// There are three tests each worth 2 points

// Note: You do not need to submit any other code including the main method or any print statements. ONLY the new_node function is required. Otherwise, the autograder will fail and be unable to grade your code. (I.e., do not include the above example in your code.) The above example should be used to test your code but deleted or commented out upon submission.
