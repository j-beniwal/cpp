// Description

// Using the started code below, write the pop method for a Stack class that returns the top integer in the stack and removes it from the stack. If there is no data on the stack the pop method should return 0. You need to have a working push method in your stack so please make sure you have successfully completed the earlier assignments.

// Note: The class fields are public only so the grader can check your code. In a real life implementation these should be private.

// Use this code to implement your method:

// #define MAX 1000

// class Stack
// {
//   public:
//   int top;
//   int a[MAX]; // Maximum size of Stack 
//   Stack() { top = -1; }
//   bool push(int x);
//   int pop();
//   int peek();
//   bool isEmpty();
// };

// Here is an example call to the function

// Stack mystack;

// mystack.push(10); 

// printf(“%i”,mystack.pop());

// After the above code executes the stack will be empty and the top field will contain the value -1. The number 10 will have been printed to the screen.

// Function Signature

// int pop();

// File Name 

// stack.h

// Score

// There are three tests each worth 2 points


// Note: You do not need to submit any other code including the main method or any print statements. ONLY the Stack class is required. Otherwise, the autograder will fail and be unable to grade your code. (I.e., do not include the above example in your code.) The above example should be used to test your code but deleted or commented out upon submission.
