### *ITRATIVE STATEMENTS (LOOPS) * ###

## while
#syntax
while (condition){
    ...
    ...
    .

}
#Symantix : the code block is executed till the condition is true

## for
#syntax

for (initialization; condition; increment){
    ..
    ..
    ..
    .
}

#symantix: the initialization statement is evaluated one time. 
           then the condition is evaluated. if condition returns ture then code block is executed. 
           after exection the increment is done.
           after increment again the condition is eveluated 
           if condition returns true the code block is executed again and flow continues. 
            
##### 
When we know the iterations then we choose the for loop. When the number of iterations is not known and based on condition then we use the while loop to break the loop.
