# Week 23 - Sorting / Sorting Lecture

The Sorting Problem
Problem
- Given an arr of numbers, reorder them, so that at the end, they are in the increasing order.
  If arr is an array containing : [5, 8, 12, 7, 8, 10]
  After sorting arr will look like : [5, 7, 8, 8, 10, 12]

Sorting Algorithms
* *Selection-Sort*
* Insertion-Sort
* Bubble-Sort
* *Merge-Sort*
* Quick-Sort
* Heap-Sort

Selection Sort
* Take first element and compare will all the elements and place the minimum element at 
  First place. Simillarly take second element and compare with the rest. and choose the 
  smallest element for second place and swap them. 
  Every time the rane on which we itrate decreases. 
  

Merge Sort
*  its a 3 step process
- Step 1: 
  Sort (recursive) the first half
- Step 2: 
  Sort (recursively) the second half
- Step 3:
  Merge the two halves together into one sorted sequence.
